*etm* is an acronym for event and task manager.

This application provides a simple, intuitive format for using plain text files to store events, tasks and other data items. In contrast to most calendar/todo applications, creating items (events, tasks, and so forth) in *etm* does not require filling out fields in a form. Instead, items are created as free-form text entries using a simple, intuitive format and stored in plain text files.

This is the home page for the version of etm that is based on Tk. An alternative version based on Qt is available at [etmqt][].
