*etm* is an acronym for event and task manager.

In contrast to most calendar/todo applications, creating items (events, tasks, and so forth) in *etm* does not require filling out fields in a form. Instead, items are created as free-form text entries using a simple, intuitive format and stored in plain text files. Please see [sample entries][] below for examples.
